Hello! I'm Murat, PhD-level educated, bilingual statistician and data scientist, who design, develop and implement advanced predictive methods, powered by machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in order to provide actionable insights from large volumes of real-world, structured and unstructured data in order to satisfy the business needs for decision making. My research interests include but are not limited to the following areas: machine learning and deep learning algorithms, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning methods, time series forecasting and modeling, big data, distribution theory, statistical analysis, optimization and operational research. 

I completed my Ph.D. dissertation, titled ”Advances and Applications in Deep Learning” under the supervision of [Dr. Michel Ballings](http://ballings.co/){:target="_blank"} (mb@utk.edu).

I was a Master of Science student at [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.hacettepe.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"} of [Hacettepe University](https://www.hacettepe.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"} in Ankara, Turkey. I received my degree at the same department in the division of Operational Research.
